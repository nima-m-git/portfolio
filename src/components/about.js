                        I spent some quality time thouroughly analyzing what I enjoy doing, what I'm good at, and what realistic prospects those could tie in to. 
                        I deduced that I enjoy being creative, am a logical and 'outside the box' thinker, highly efficient and get great satisfaction out of improving efficiencies, highly analytical, enjoy problem solving, and work that is rewarding.
                        Programming came in the top of these, along with entrapaneurship and business strategy consulting. I'd like to develop digital solutions to automate and improve business efficiencies.
                        Around winter 2018 I was working at two places; I wanted to contribute more than the basic tasks I was doing in unique and lasting ways. I began learning and implementing ways to automate some repetitive manual tasks.
                        Thus my programming journey began.

                        I enjoy building all kinds of software, and have great interest in data science & machine learning applications.

                        <span class='big'>Education</span><br></br>
                        I received my Bachelor of Science in Chemistry in 2017. Why chemistry? I'm a very curious person, I like to know how things work - chemistry is the base and building block of everything.
                        <br></br>E.g- How are you seeing this right now? Short; Many photons (light particles) emitted at specific wavelengths (giving their color), determined by your computer through the flow of electromagnetic fields to various materials composing the circuitry (translating to digital information).
                        How do your eyes receive these images? How does your brain translate optical information to meaning? How do you process information? Why do you want to do any of this? Why is the sky blue?
                        I wanted to use this knowledge to make the world better somehow: develop life-saving medicine, bio-hack the genome to induce regeneration, discover more favourable process to break down plastics.   
                        ..You get the point, I could go on forever - and I love to actually, feel free to <a href='/contact'>contact me</a> to talk all things science.

                        <span class='big'>Hobbies</span><br></br>
                        I have a wide array of interests: science, technology, business, economics, politics, history, music, art, sports, food, culture, you name it. <a href='/contact'>Talk to me</a> about anything. 
                        I like learning new things, travelling the world, exploring the outdoors, music, cooking, eating, sunsets, sports, weightlifting, board/card games, observing other organisms.
